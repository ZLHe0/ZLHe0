ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Zelin He.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I am working on large language and vision-language models for time-series reasoning, as well as building transfer-learning and meta-learning methods for modeling large-scale, crowd-sourced datasets.

ðŸ’¡ I am enthusiastic about collaborating with like-minded individuals and organizations on projects.

ðŸ“¬ Feel free to reach out to me at zelinhe0@outlook.com or on my LinkedIn profile [www.linkedin.com/in/zelin-he].

Looking forward to engaging with fellow enthusiasts and making meaningful contributions together!
